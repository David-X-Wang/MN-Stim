# MNstimulation
Multi-Noise Deep Brain Stimulation Paradigm is a open-loop deep brain stimulation paradigm that apply biphasic balance-charged electrical pulses directly to the target brain cortecies.  
This open loop stimulation paradigm aims at capturing neural dymanical reponses of certain brain regions (neocortecies and hippocampus) for the system identification (modeling) in the development of a closed-loop brain computer interfaces. 

This paradigm is based on Neural Signal Processor (NSP), Cerestim Stimulator and other relavent peripheral devices (including cables, front-end amplifier, adaptors, etc) manufactured by Blackrock Neurotech (https://blackrockneurotech.com/)
