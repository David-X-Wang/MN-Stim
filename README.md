The multi-noise stimulation is a part of the brain-computer interface development at the Texas Computational Memory Lab (Lega Lab), Department of Neurological Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.

Multi-Noise Deep Brain Stimulation Paradigm is a open-loop deep brain stimulation paradigm that apply biphasic balance-charged electrical pulses directly to the target brain cortecies.  
This open loop stimulation paradigm aims at capturing neural dymanical reponses of certain brain regions (neocortecies and hippocampus) for the system identification (modeling) in the development of a closed-loop brain computer interfaces. 

This paradigm is based on Neural Signal Processor (NSP), Cerestim Stimulator and other relavent peripheral devices (including cables, front-end amplifier, adaptors, etc) manufactured by Blackrock Neurotech (https://blackrockneurotech.com/)

This Package 

1. Scripts and configurations for multi-noise stimulation using Ceresetim.
2. Scripts and configurations for processing iEEG collected by NSP module.
3.
